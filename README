I have implemented a C to python translator(basic conversions) using Lex as part of the compilers course.

Lex file description:

0. Remove improper indentation
1. Add proper indentation
2. Change function definitions
3. Modify conditional and looping constructs
4. Remove #includes and put proper printing statements

Other files : run.sh - To convert the given code to C run this script with argument as the C file name. It generates the output.py file which can be run with "python output.py"
